DOM - Document Object Model 
HTML 
----
Head - Website Name
Body - Content Tags
Link - extra information is attributes [Ex : <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">]
 
Advantages 
----------
Readability - Helpful in Code Review
Modular - Divide the code into different parts 
Browser Caching - Loading Time Faster

WINDOW OBJECT
-------------
The window object represents an open window in a browser. It is browser's object(not js) & is automatically created by browser.
It's a global object with lots of properties & methods.

Document Object Model - When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page

Html code transfrom into object in js file -> document object -> Window object
Html code is available in document object & document object is available in window object 

CONSOLE
--------
window
window.document 
window.dir -> special objects like document its properties & method print / to print oject we use window.dir not console.log(window.document)
console.log(window.document)

Document - model / representation of html code

DYNAMICALLY CHANGE WEBSITE HTML CODE
------------------------------------
document.body.style.background = "green";
document.body.childNodes[1].innerText="abcd";

DOM MANIPULATION 
----------------
Selecting with id 
- document.getElementById("myId")

Selecting with class 
- document.getElementsByClassName("myClass")

Selecting with tag 
- document.getElementsByTagName("p")

* If we write our script tag in head then we won't be able to access our Html body - It will return null - that's why we have to write it just before closing of body tag
