CLASSES & OBJECTS 
-----------------
CLASS : A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have. Classes were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to make object-oriented programming easier.

OBJECTS : An object is an instance of a class. It contains the properties and methods defined by the class.

PROTOTYPES IN JS
----------------
A javascript object is an entity having state and behaviour (properties and method)
JS objects have a special property called prototype 
We can set prototype using __proto__ 

*If object & prototype have same method, object's method will be used

CLASSES IN JS
-------------
Class is a program-code template for creating objects 
Those objects will have some state (variables) & some behaviour (functions) inside it 

class MyClass{
    constructor() {...}
    myMethod() {...}
}

let myObj = new MyClass();
