/* Here is the pseudocode for your `findMissing` function:

```
FUNCTION findMissing(array)
    CREATE completeList as array of numbers from 1 to 10
    SET missingNumbers to empty array

    FOR each number IN completeList DO
        IF number is NOT in array THEN
            ADD number to missingNumbers

    RETURN missingNumbers
```

function findMissing(array) {
    const completeList = Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => i + 1);
    const missingNumbers = [];
    for (const number of completeList) {
        if (!array.includes(number)) {
            missingNumbers.push(number);
        }
    }
    return missingNumbers;
}

**Explanation:**
1. Generate a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2. For each number in this list, check if it is present in the input array.
3. If not present, add it to the result array.
4. Return the array of missing numbers. */
