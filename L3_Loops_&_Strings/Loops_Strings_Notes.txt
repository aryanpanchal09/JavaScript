Loops
-----
Loops are used to execute a piece of code again and again 

for loop 
for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
    console.log("hii");
}
i = 1 - initilize - it happens only 1 time
i <= 5 - stopping condition 
i++ - updation

i = 1, i <= 5 - T 
i = 2, i <= 5 - T 
i = 3, i <= 5 - T 
i = 4, i <= 5 - T 
i = 5, i <= 5 - T 
i = 6, i <= 5 - F - Code execution stops 

INFINITE Loops
--------------
A loop that never ends - to be never executed in a program 
It occurs when stopping condition never fails 

WHILE LOOPS 
-----------
while(condition){
    work 
}

DO WHILE LOOPS 
--------------
Guarentee that it will one atleast 1 time 
do{
    // do some work
}while(condition)

FOR-OF LOOPS
------------
for(let val of strVar){
    // loops on Strings and Arrays
}

only initization, no condition and updatation required
not to be used for objects 

FOR-IN LOOPS
------------
Used for objects with the help of keys
for(let val of strVar){
    // do some work
}

STRINGS IN JS 
-------------
String is a sequence of characters used to represent text 

Create String - let str = "Apna Colledge"
String length - str.length
String Indices - str[0], str[1], str[2]

Inbuild properties & functions(method)

Index - Indices both are same one is singular and one is plural 

TEMPLATE LITERAL 
----------------
It's a way to have embedded expressions in strings 
'example of temp literal'

STRING INTERPOLATION 
--------------------
To create strings by doing substituion of placeholders
`string text${expression} string text`;

ESCAPE CHARACTERS 
-----------------
To break the line in console.log statement use 
(\n) - to break the line, - they count as a single character 
(\t) - to have the tab space;

Ex - Apna\nColledge - str.length = 12

STRING METHODS
--------------
They are built-in functions to manipulate a string 
. str.toUpperCase()

. str.toLowerCase()

. str.trim() // removes whitespace from the starting and ending end 

. str.slice(start, end?) // returns part of string - End values are non-inclusive

. str1.concat(str2) // joins str2 with str1 

. str.replace(searchVal, newVal)

. str.charAt(idx)

Method - A block of code which does some work for us
Always remeber method doesn't change the value or string it creates a new one 

Why does this happen ?
Becuase Strings are Immutable in JS - their value can't be changed indirectly 

Function -
