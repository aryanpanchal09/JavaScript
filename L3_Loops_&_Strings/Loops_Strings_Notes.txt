Loops
-----
Loops are used to execute a piece of code again and again 

for loop 
for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
    console.log("hii");
}
i = 1 - initilize - it happens only 1 time
i <= 5 - stopping condition 
i++ - updation

i = 1, i <= 5 - T 
i = 2, i <= 5 - T 
i = 3, i <= 5 - T 
i = 4, i <= 5 - T 
i = 5, i <= 5 - T 
i = 6, i <= 5 - F - Code execution stops 

INFINITE Loops
--------------
A loop that never ends - to be never executed in a program 
It occurs when stopping condition never fails 

WHILE LOOPS 
-----------
while(condition){
    work 
}

DO WHILE LOOPS 
--------------
Guarentee that it will one atleast 1 time 
do{
    // do some work
}while(condition)

FOR-OF LOOPS
------------
for(let val of strVar){
    // loops on Strings and Arrays
}

only initization, no condition and updatation required
not to be used for objects 

FOR-IN LOOPS
------------
Used for objects with the help of keys
for(let val of strVar){
    // do some work
}
