ARRAYS 
------
Important DataStructure to store different types of data 
Used to store same type of Information in a linear fashion 

Collections of Items 
Items can be access acc to their index value 

let heroes = ["hulk", "ironman"];
let marks = [89,67,98,34];

Multiple items store but name should be same

Properties - returns a value 
Methods - does some work 

Arrays type of Object 

ARRAY INDICES
-------------
How to access index in JS 
arr[0] / marks[0]

marks[0] = 98;

Array value can be change easily but it's not applicable in String 

Array are muttable 

LOOPING 
-------
To print all elements of an array 

for loop : length 
for(let idx = 0; idx < arr.length; idx++){

}
remember idx < array.length not <= as it's always smaller than array length 

ARRAYS METHODS 
--------------
2 Methods
- Change 
- Don't change give back new array 

push(): add to end in array 
pop(): delete from end & return 
toString(): converts array to string 
concat(): joins multiple arrays & returns result 
unshift(): add to start - It's equivilant to push method
shift(): delete from start & return 
slice(): returns a piece of the array - Same working as String Method - don't change in original array 
         slice(startldx, endldx)
        - Ending index is non-inclusive - End index will not include 
        - If no specific slice is given slice() if it's null then it's useful for creating an copy of an array 
splice(): change original array(add,remove,replace)
         splice(startldx,delCount,newEl1...)
         - If only 1 value is given then it will return only 1 element
